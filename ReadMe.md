# CCNTreeNode (discontinued)

*__Update__: 12 August 2014*

As this peace of code intentionally were produced for a customer project I found a better solution ([JTTree](https://github.com/jtbandes/JTTree)). Therefore it will stay open but discontinued. No more development on it.

#### Via Drag&Drop
Just drag the `CCNTreeNode.*` files into your project.
